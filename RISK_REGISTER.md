| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Early Warning | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Raw `/api/ingest` continues to store device IDs overseas | High until P0 ships | Critical — violates Mode A residency, triggers regulator scrutiny | Disable raw path, require pseudonymized batches, purge historical raw IDs | Cloudflare logs showing `/api/ingest` hits with `device_id`; D1 rows containing plaintext IDs | Worker Platform |
| Access JWT validation missing issuer/tolerance | Medium | High — spoofed tokens reach operator APIs | Patch `requireAccessUser` to enforce issuer + `clockTolerance`; add regression tests | Auth logs showing cross-app token reuse; alerts for skew-related errors | Platform Auth |
| Export schema/key drift (pseudoId vs didPseudo, missing signature key) | Medium | High — exports fail so teams keep unsafe legacy ingest | Align schema fields across CN/export/SDK, store Ed25519 pubkey via secret, add healthcheck | Overseas Worker returning 400/500 on batch ingest; CN exporter retries climbing | Platform API |
| SAFE metric mismatch between CN gateway & SDKs | Medium | Medium — engineers bypass gateway to recover missing metrics | Reconcile SAFE lists, document rationale, add unit tests comparing arrays | PRs adding metrics outside SAFE set; support tickets about missing firmware/alerts | SDK + CN Gateway Leads |
| Privacy/compliance docs out of sync with implementation | Medium | Medium — audit blockers or misleading notices | Update Mode A docs + bilingual notice once architecture matches; add doc-review checklist | Audit prep reviews flagging inconsistent statements; support escalations asking about pseudonyms | Compliance + Legal |
