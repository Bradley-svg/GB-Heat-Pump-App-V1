| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Early Warning | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Raw `/api/ingest` re-enabled by mistake | Medium | Critical — violates Mode A residency, triggers regulator scrutiny | Keep `ALLOW_RAW_INGEST` unset in prod, monitor for `raw_ingest_disabled` logs, enforce signed batch pipeline | Cloudflare logs showing `/api/ingest` 2xx responses; `/health` on overseas Worker invoked by devices | Worker Platform |
| Access JWT verification regressions | Low | High — spoofed tokens reach operator APIs | Issuer + 60 s clock tolerance now enforced; monitor Access audit logs and alert on 403 spikes | Auth logs showing cross-app token reuse; Access audit anomalies | Platform Auth |
| Ed25519 verification key rotation not tied to CN signer rotation | Medium | High — if CN rotates signing key without updating overseas verifier, batches fail or signature checking is disabled | Platform API Lead owns Wrangler secret; rotate verification key every time CN gateway rotates its signer (minimum annually) and document in change tickets | `/health` reporting `signatureConfigured: false`; exporter retries due to 4xx/5xx | Platform API Lead |
| SAFE metric mismatch between CN gateway & SDKs | Low | Medium — engineers might bypass gateway to recover missing metrics | SDK SAFE list + schemas now mirror the CN gateway; add lint to block reintroduction | PRs re-adding removed properties; support tickets asking for firmware/alerts over Mode A path | SDK + CN Gateway Leads |
| Privacy/compliance docs out of sync with implementation | Low | Medium — audit blockers or misleading notices | Operator notice refreshed (UTF-8 Mandarin) and Mode A doc points to disabled raw ingest; schedule quarterly doc review | Audit prep reviews flag inconsistencies | Compliance + Legal |
